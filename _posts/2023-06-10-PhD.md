## Introduction

Extreme space weather events, such as geomagnetic storms, pose significant risks to our technological infrastructure, from satellite communications to power grids. My research explores a novel approach to predicting these extreme events by applying network analysis. Using signal processing and machine learning techniques, I aim to better understand the magnetosphere's response to solar activity. The work in this article is a general overview for non-experts of my [scientific paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JA031175) (open access) which you can access for more details.

## The Challenge: Understanding Space Weather's Impact

Space weather poses real risks to our technological infrastructure. From satellite communications to power grids, the effects of solar activity can disrupt critical systems we rely on daily. The key challenge lies in predicting how our magnetosphere (Earth's magnetic shield) responds to these solar events.

For example, in March 1989, a powerful geomagnetic storm caused a nine-hour power outage in Quebec, leaving millions without electricity. Understanding such events isn't just academic—it’s vital for safeguarding our technological infrastructure.

## A Novel Approach: Network Analysis

To address this challenge, we developed an innovative method using dynamical networks to analyse space weather patterns. Specifically, we built a dynamical network to track wave propagation in the magnetosphere. Monitoring the movement of waves along Earth’s magnetic field lines is important, as these waves can energise particles that can damage or disrupting both space-based and terrestrial infrastructure.

- **Nodes** represent ground-based magnetometer stations
- **Edges** show correlations between magnetic field measurements
- **Network evolution** reveals how space weather events propagate globally

The header image in this article details the network response to the 2015 St. Patrick's Day geomagnetic storm, sub-networks with specific geospatial properties are shown in different colour. Magnetometer stations with connections are shown in red, and those without connections in black. This analysis demonstrated these networks can effectively categorise the dynamics of geomagnetic storms (see further down for implications of the analysis).

## Analysis methods

This study  data provided by collaborators at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Physics, obtained through global research partnerships. The methodology introduces several novel approaches:

1. **High-Resolution Time Series Data**: Leveraged data from a global array of ground-based magnetometers which take magnetic field measurements at second-resolution to study global wave patterns in unprecedented detail.
2. **Advanced Signal Processing**: 
   - Extracted specific wave frequencies from magnetic field time series data.
   - Applied sophisticated filtering techniques.
   - Developed robust correlation and thresholding methods.
3. **Network Analysis**:
   - Unsupervised machine learning:
      - Community detection
      - Modularity optimisation for cluster identification.
      - Clustering coefficient evolution during storms.
   - Topological analysis:
      - Betweenness centrality for critical node identification.
      - Path length distributions for connectivity analysis.
4. **Validation Framework**:
   - Statistical significance testing, null model comparison:
      - Surrogate times series data used to create surrogate networks for comparison. 

The data was obtained from collaborators at the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Physics.
